Sprint Planning Meeting
Sprint Goal: Add more basic functionalities for users and charities now that we have basic working login systems.

Date: February 15, 2022.

By the end of this sprint we want to have business and donor services up partially. This includes being able to add listings as a donor or viewing listings as a Charitable Organization. Additionally, we want to build working ui and a much better ux experience for the users. Finally, we want to add the ability for individual donors to search up wanted items by Charitable Organizations near them.

Spikes:
UI and UX take quite a bit of work.
One of our members isn’t available for a few days during the reading week.
Midterms are also right after reading week and may hurt development time availability.
Another member caught covid during the final sprint week.

Related Stories:
As a Donor, I want my commonly donated food items to be displayed on my profile page, so that Charities can see what my common donation items are.
As a Donor, I want to be able to remove my donation listing, so Donation Center’s don’t come to pick up goods that aren’t there.
As a Charitable Organization, I want to be able to view donation listings and the business donating them, so I can consider which business would be best to get donations from.
As a Charitable Organization, I want to be able to search listings by item tags or filters so that I can find effective pickups faster
As an Individual Donor I want to go to givenet.com and search up my donation item, so that I can see which charities want this item.
As a Donor, I want to be able to add a donation listing, so that Charities can view and accept the listing.
Remake the frontend of all pages for sprint0. (Not a user story, but a task that needs to get done regardless)
(This one is a developer task and not directly related to a particular user)
Make changes to database

Team capacity:
School work has been mentally draining and has taken a toll on the members. In addition, midterms are around the corner and may require members to distribute time resources to other school work. However, we do have additional time because of reading week, although another course 309 has a large assignment due during the week as well.
