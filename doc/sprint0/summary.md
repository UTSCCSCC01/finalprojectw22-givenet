Project Objective:
This project aims to act as a networking tool to connect donation centers (food banks, soup kitchens, homeless shelters etc.) and local businesses who have an excess of non-monetary charitable goods (food, clothing). In particular, these goods would be collected by the charitable organizations from businesses who want to reduce the waste in their community. The tool will help donors find food banks that are looking for their particular items.

Key Personas:
Caleeba Boyle is a thirty-one year old working in the finance sector who lives in Mississauga. She has a passion for inventing new recipes and often overbuys ingredients. She feels bad about throwing out untouched ingredients for recipes she didn’t have time to get to, and wants a better solution.
Brian Mays is a thirty-six year old Operations Manager at a food bank in the GTA. He is deeply connected to his community and very passionate about food. He works full time at this foodbank, but also volunteers on the weekends.

Andrea Hall is a thirty-eight-year-old bakery owner. She had a tough upbringing but came out being a caring and optimistic person. Her employees generally consist of family friends or people she knows are in a tough spot.

The Key Scenarios:

    Andrea is the owner of a small bakery. Everyday, she finds herself and her employees throwing out baked goods that are only to be sold the day that they were made. These goods are still perfectly consumable, and she knows it is extremely wasteful to just throw them out. Andrea wants an easy way to donate these goods to a food bank so she can have peace of mind, but she’s not sure which food banks need baked goods, or how to get connected with them to do a pickup.

    Alice is the manager of a local food bank. Her organization is struggling to provide food every month. More people have been visiting her food bank and donations have decreased significantly because of the pandemic. Alice can’t afford to make long trips to pick up small donations anymore due to the lack of volunteers and rising gas prices.

    The Key Principles:

    The network should be able to link up multiple smaller donations from businesses to create a route for food banks that would be worth it to take. This way, small donations can still be viable for pickup.

    Donors should be able to view which organizations are accepting what items.
