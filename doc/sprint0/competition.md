GiveNet is a service that provides non-profit organizations and local businesses a way to network small non-monetary donations easily. These organizations collect donations through online submission forms or by phone-call appointment and currently these methods are limited by the number of resources that these organizations can use. With GiveNet, donors will be able to search the item that they want to donate, and see what organizations need those items. They will also be provided with an option to provide a location so that the organizations will be displayed based on distance from the location.

The Competition
The Daily Bread, a food bank, does have a pick-up request system. However, they are unable to commit to donations that are less than 250 lbs of food. They provide an alternative drop-off service with local firehouses, but they only accept non-perishable foods.
Another food collection tool available is the food bank map, which helps users locate the closest food bank to a given address. This tool helps with drop-off donations from individuals, but it does not help the organization coordinate pickups, nor does it tell users what donations are needed. Users who don’t have the time to drop off donations but have the resources may struggle to complete their donations.
One similar tool available in Canada is the Second Harvest’s Food Rescue program. Food Rescue allows food producers and businesses to send out a “rescue request” for food overage. This notification is then pushed to a non-profit organization for pickup.

How is your product different?
GiveNet focuses on showing donors what organizations actually need in terms of food donations. Oftentimes, donors donate items which are not needed by a charity or unacceptable for a food bank. This problem leaves non-profit organizations with the disposal responsibilities, sometimes resulting in huge disposal fees. “Just because someone COULD use your item, doesn’t mean a charity has the means to get that item into the hands of someone who wants it.”

As a secondary objective, GiveNet still wants to provide Businesses with a pick-up coordination feature between businesses and nonprofits.
Organizations do not always have the time or resources to collect smaller donations, donors may not always be able to deliver their donations and charities may not even need certain donations. The need for this tool arises from that problem which has been amplified by covid-19. According to Food Banks Canada, food banks and community agencies have experienced “drastic reductions in volunteers and staff” as well as “some markets are seeing a 50% drop in food donations.” It doesn’t help that donors are not able to see which charities will take their donations. Similar to how Peel’s “How to sort your waste” webpage helps users figure out where their waste goes, GiveNet aims to help donors figure out where their donations should go.
