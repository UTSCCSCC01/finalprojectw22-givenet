Sprint Goal:

We want to have a basic working site with simple capabilities by the end of the sprint. This includes the ability to interact with the system for our main users (Donors and Charitable Organization). However these uses will be independent from one another during this sprint. Additionally, we want to start building the framework and designs of the pages while having a semi-finalized database at the end.

Spikes:
Further discussion with charitable organization required for better feature development
Lots of members need refreshers on react and need to learn express.

Related Stories:
As a Donor, I want to have a profile page so I can have information like common pick up times and view all my listings
As an Admin, I want to be able to add new item tags / filters so that businesses and donation centers can use them in their listings.
As a Charitable Organization, I want to have a profile page so that I can display the items I need most and have my information like typical hours of operation available publicly.
As a User, I want to have an account that suits my use case (Business, Donation Center, etc), so that I can use the features I need.

Team capacity:
This particular sprint all members are ready for work. However, other course work during this sprint is particularly heavier and may affect sprint velocity. No one has fallen ill (yet) and there are no vacations.
