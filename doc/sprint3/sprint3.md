Sprint Planning Meeting
Sprint Goal: Add more basic functionalities for users and charities now that we have basic working login systems.

Date: Mar 8, 2022

By the end of this sprint we want to redesign our entire project to reflect the new and improved database changes. Additionally, we want to clean up any unfinished stories from sprint 2. On top of those goals we want to move further with minor tasks for listings so that we maximize our sprint velocity.

Spikes:
A full project redesign is an incredibly large task.
We decided to take on a much heavier sprint to try and complete as many user stories as possible.
Many participants are behind in lectures due to assignments
